A custom MVC blog website based on object oriented PHP

To get real inside of object oriented PHP, I worked on this project. An MVC design pattern provides more control on making a web apps because of its simplicity and reusability of the codes. 

This project aimed at following and using most of the functions of Object Oriented PHP including class, inheritence, abstract class, static method, traits, namespace, constructor, destructor, autoload class and constatnts which are the core things of OOPHP. In addition, I tried to follow the MVC design pattern to deal with the http requests by creating controller, to manage the database by using Model and finally the view part to show the webpages the users.

Features:

1. User Authentication
2. Creating Post
3. Updating Post
4. Delete post
5. Error and Success message using HTTP session
